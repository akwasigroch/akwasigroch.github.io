However, successful deployment of such systems is determined by proper manual selection of the neural architecture. This is a tedious and time-consuming process that requires expert knowledge. Different tasks need very different architectures to obtain satisfactory results. The group of methods called the neural architecture search (NAS) helps to find effective architecture in an automated manner. In this paper, we present the use of an architecture search framework to solve the medical task of malignant melanoma detection. Unlike many other methods tested on benchmark datasets, we tested it on practical problem, which differs greatly in terms of difficulty in distinguishing between classes, resolution of images, data balance within the classes, and the number of data available. In order to find a suitable network structure, the hill-climbing search strategy was employed along with network morphism operations to explore the search space. The network morphism operations allow for incremental increases in the network size with the use of the previously trained network. This kind of knowledge reusing allows significantly reducing the computational cost. The proposed approach produces structures that achieve similar results to those provided by manually designed structures, at the same time making use of almost 20 times fewer parameters. What is more, the search process lasts on average only 18h on single GPU.","tags":null,"title":"Neural Architecture Search for Skin Lesion Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arkadiusz Kwasigroch","Michał Grochowski","Mateusz Mikołajczyk"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"418f90d3110440bcd42cfdbf778a185c","permalink":"https://akwasigroch.github.io/publication/network_morphism_mmar/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/network_morphism_mmar/","section":"publication","summary":"The paper presents the results of the research on neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm.

Among many kinds of DNNs, the convolutional neural networks (CNN) are most commonly used. However, due to their complexity, there are many problems related but not limited to optimizing network parameters, avoiding overfitting and ensuring good generalization abilities. Therefore, a number of methods have been proposed by the researchers to deal with these problems. In this paper, we present the results of applying different, recently developed methods to improve deep neural network training and operating. We decided to focus on the most popular CNN structures, namely on VGG based neural networks: VGG16, VGG11 and proposed by us VGG8. The tests were conducted on a real and very important problem of skin cancer detection. A publicly available dataset of skin lesions was used as a benchmark. We analyzed the influence of applying: dropout, batch normalization, model ensembling, and transfer learning. Moreover, the influence of the type of activation function was checked. In order to increase the objectivity of the results, each of the tested models was trained 6 times and their results were averaged. In addition, in order to mitigate the impact of the selection of learning, test and validation sets, k-fold validation was applied.","tags":null,"title":"Selected technical issues of deep neural networks for image classification purposes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michał Grochowski","Agnieszka Mikołajczyk","Arkadiusz Kwasigroch"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"d666967953dad73b063eabda6ca59070","permalink":"https://akwasigroch.github.io/publication/diagnosis_of_mal/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/diagnosis_of_mal/","section":"publication","summary":"Malignant melanomas are the most deadly type of skin cancer, yet detected early have high chances of successful treatment. In the last twenty years, the interest in automatic recognition and classification of melanoma dynamically increased, partly because of appearing public datasets with dermatoscopic images of skin lesions. Automated computer-aided skin cancer detection in dermatoscopic images is a very challenging task due to uneven sizes of datasets, huge intra-class variation with small interclass variation, and the existence of many artifacts in the images. One of the most recognized methods of melanoma diagnosis is the ABCD method. In the paper, we propose an extended version of this method and an intelligent decision support system based on neural networks that uses its results in the form of hand-crafted features. Automatic determination of the skin features with the ABCD method is difficult due to the large diversity of images of various quality, the existence of hair, different markers and other obstacles. Therefore, it was necessary to apply advanced methods of pre-processing the images. The proposed system is an ensemble of ten neural networks working in parallel, and one network using their results to generate a final decision. This system structure enables to increase the efficiency of its operation by several percentage points compared with a single neural network. The proposed system is trained on over 5000 and tested afterwards on 200 skin moles. The presented system can be used as a decision support system for primary care physicians, as a system capable of self-examination of the skin with a dermatoscope and also as an important tool to improve biopsy decision making.","tags":null,"title":"Diagnosis of Malignant Melanoma by Neural Network Ensemble-Based System Utilising Hand-Crafted Skin Lesion Features","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arkadiusz Kwasigroch","Bartłomiej Jarzembinski","Michał Grochowski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522540800,"objectID":"9d5575946a6ad4b2f027ab68afd417dc","permalink":"https://akwasigroch.github.io/publication/iiphdw/","publishdate":"2018-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iiphdw/","section":"publication","summary":"The diabetic retinopathy is a disease caused by long-standing diabetes. Lack of effective treatment can lead to vision impairment and even irreversible blindness. The disease can be diagnosed by examining digital color fundus photographs of retina. In this paper we propose deep learning approach to automated diabetic retinopathy screening. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) - the most popular kind of deep learning algorithms - enjoyed great success in the field of image analysis and recognition. Therefore, we leverage CNN networks to diagnose the diabetic retinopathy and its current stage, based on analysis of the photographs of retina. The utilized models were trained using dataset containing over 88000 retina photographs, labeled by specialist clinicians. To enhance the performance of the system, we proposed a special class coding technique that enabled to include the information about value of difference between predicted score and target score into the objective function being minimized during the neural networks training. To evaluate classification ability of employed models we used standard accuracy metrics and quadratic weighted Kappa score that is calculated between the predicted scores and scores provided in the dataset. The best tested model achieved an accuracy of about 82% in detecting the retinopathy and 51% in assessing its stage. Moreover, system obtained decent Kappa score equal 0.776. Achieved results showed that deep learning algorithms can be successfully employed to solve this very hard to analyze problem.","tags":null,"title":"Deep CNN based decision support system for detection and assessing the stage of diabetic retinopathy","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":0,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":0,"objectID":"0b1bb49bbb8642b9f33e7bb0864af91e","permalink":"https://akwasigroch.github.io/talk/semisupervised_learing/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/semisupervised_learing/","section":"talk","summary":"The date will be announced soon","tags":[],"title":"Semi-supervised learning in computer vision (date TBA)","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8e7bc052bdfc6746ea2bb6595e8093eb","permalink":"https://akwasigroch.github.io/home/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/home/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
